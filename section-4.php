      I am 77 and run an all-arts camp empowering women with my daughter, 47. I do the jobs that suit me: write letters, deal with prospective staff, help the younger women. The experiences I have gained I am passing on to the younger generation.

      Even if many continue to work because they want to, there are, of course, financial benefits to remaining on the job. As economist Larry Kotlikoff has pointed out in his weekly column, Social Security&rsquo;s rules encourage you to work for as long as possible. His post <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/businessdesk/2013/02/how-social-security-pays-you-t-1.html">How Social Security Pays You to Keep Working Forever</a> was wildly popular with PBS NewsHour's online audience.

      For those of you who do work into older age, then, there are obvious benefits to you. And, it turns out, there are benefits to the economy as well.

      I think there&rsquo;s a kind of sweet spot that&rsquo;s emerging in life that&rsquo;s a function of the longevity revolution.

      Manufacturer Vita Needle Finds Investment in Older Workers Turns a Big Profit
    </h2>

    <p>
      The average age of Vita Needle's workers is 74, and that's no accident. The manufacturing company has intentionally hired seniors&mdash;a decision that&rsquo;s been good for the bottom line and benefited older workers who often have a hard time finding a job. We look into the firm&rsquo;s unique business model in this video.

      Most 65-plus workers say they couldn&rsquo;t be happier with their job. (Less than a third of 16 to 64-year-olds say the same thing.) A little over a quarter say their motivation for working is a combination of wanting to and needing to.
