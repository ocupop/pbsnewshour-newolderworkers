            You are significantly more likely than a woman to feel very confident about having enough money for medical expenses and that you will live comfortably in retirement.

          <h3>Family Matters</h3>
          <p>
            In addition, working women are more likely than men to interrupt their careers to take care of family members, which means lower lifetime income, lower contributions to Social Security and thus lower Social Security benefits upon retirement.
          </p>

          <h3>Income</h3>
          <p>
            You make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes, as an average across all occupations. So again, your Social Security benefits, should you qualify, will be a bit lower.
          </p>

          <h3>Mind the Gap</h3>
          <p>
            On average, your retirement account is worth 38.25% <strong>less</strong> than a man&rsquo;s. (However, that gap is slowly closing.)

              In a household where the wife stayed home to raise the kids and then enters  the workforce in her 40s or 50s, you often find she will put a much, much higher percentage into her retirement savings than a woman of the same age who’s worked her whole life. This is an acknowledgement that she has to catch up for all those years she missed.

        While the Great Recession took a toll on everyone, there was a distinct difference between rural and urban America. The percentage of older Americans employed full- or part-time actually declined in the most urban, densely populated counties. In smaller rural counties, however, the number of older Americans in the workforce rose sharply.
