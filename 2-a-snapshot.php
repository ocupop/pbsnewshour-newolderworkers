        You are likely to live longer and thus have higher health care expenses than men.

        You are more likely to work in part-time jobs that don&rsquo;t qualify for a retirement plan.

        In addition, working women are more likely than men to interrupt their careers to take care of family members, which means lower lifetime income, lower contributions to Social Security and thus lower Social Security benefits upon retirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        You make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes, as an average across all occupations. So again, your Social Security benefits, should you qualify, will be a bit lower. Our Social Security guru Larry Kotlikoff (more on him later) ran a simulation for a woman earning $77,000 a year and a man earning $100,000 a year for the same job. Assuming they both begin working at 30, retire at 65 and start taking benefits at 67, the man will receive an annual benefit of $39,020. The woman, $34,688&mdash;about 88% of the man&rsquo;s benefit. So while women are still getting less than their higher-paid male counterparts, a bit of the difference is made up in annual SS benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        On average, your retirement account is worth 38.25% LESS than a man&rsquo;s. (However, that gap is slowly closing.)

      <q>
        In a household where the wife stayed home to raise the kids and then enters  the workforce in her 40s or 50s, you often find she will put a much, much higher percentage into her retirement savings than a woman of the same age who&rsquo;s worked her whole life. This is an acknowledgement that she has to catch up for all those years she missed.

        After I retired [at age 66] I competed for a volunteer docent position at a large local museum, received two years of intensive training comparable to an undergraduate degree in art history, and am now immersed in a whole new life of work! It is wonderful to re-pot yourself and let younger people step up.

        You are significantly more likely than a woman to feel very confident about having enough money for medical expenses and that you will live comfortably in retirement.

        I was tentatively flirting with early retirement in the late &lsquo;90s until my neatly-built nest egg disappeared with the dot-com downturn. I stayed on and continued to progress up the ladder of success until 2008 when that rug was pulled out from under me&hellip; again! I am now a farmer! And I'm going to stay a farmer until they pry my cold, dead hands off my (soon to be bought) tractor.

    The most important message is to show the difference
    between communities: The percentage of older Americans
    employed full- or part-time actually declined in the
    most urban, densely populated counties. In smaller
    rural counties, however, the number of older Americans
    in the workforce rose sharply.

    I'd go with this list, from important at the top to less necessary at the end:

      Employment
        EMPLOYED FULL TIME (30+ HOURS)
        EMPLOYED PART TIME (<30 HOURS)
        EMPLOYED FULL OR PART TIME
        NOT EMPLOYED (ANY)
        etc

      Employment sector
        YOUR EMPLOYMENT: AGRICULTURE/FORESTRY/FISHING/HUNTING
        YOUR EMPLOYMENT: MINING/CONSTRUCTION
        etc

      Income
        INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT INCOME: <$12,500
        INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT INCOME: $12,500 - $24,999
        INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT INCOME: $25,000 - $49,999
        INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT INCOME: $50,000 - $74,999
        INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT INCOME: $75,000 - $99,999
        INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT INCOME: $100,000 - $149,999
        INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT INCOME: $150,000+

    BASED ON DEFINITIONS OF A, B, C AND D COUNTIES, via Dante:
    "A" -- Highly urbanized areas. Combined, A counties comprise 40% of households.
    "B" – Less populated than A,  but have more than 85,000 households. They make up 30% of households.
    "C" – Rural areas that are less populated than B, but have at least 20,000 households. They contain about 15% of households.
    "D" – Very rural and sparsely populated. They contain 15% of households.

    <h2>
      The Urban/Rural Divide
    </h2>

    <p class="caption">
      When you look at a geographic breakdown of older workers, a few points jump out. While the Great Recession took a toll on everyone, when looking at older workers, there was a distinct difference between rural and urban America. The percentage of older Americans employed full- or part-time actually declined in the most urban, densely populated counties. In smaller rural counties, however, the number of older Americans in the workforce rose sharply. Does that mean rural America is actually better for older workers&mdash;a haven for those working for enjoyment or personal fulfillment? Read on.
