    Note: these numbers are based on a single person and do not take into account Social Security, pensions, etc. They also assume starting with $0 savings, retiring at 65, getting a 7% return on your savings, and leaving nothing for heirs or charity. All figures in 2012 dollars.

      Warning: The 7% return presumes a portfolio mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, using actual historical returns for this mix of assets. But as Sheryl Garrett (CFP&reg;, AIF&reg;, founder of The Garrett Planning Network, Inc.), who provided the data, points out, timing can make all the difference. Volatility can change the outcome of a 7% average annual return dramatically. If markets nosedive in the first two or three years of your retirement, you will have far less money on which to earn a return than if they stayed level or soared. In other words, you could receive a 7% average annual return over 20 years, say, but if your nest egg shrank drastically in the first few years, you might have nothing to tide you over until markets rallied.

      According to the Social Security Administration, for most of us, Social Security alone will not provide enough income for a comfortable living, even assuming the program experiences no benefit cuts in coming years.

  <div class="contents">
    <p class="intro">
      The Great Recession swept away about 40% of Americans&rsquo; wealth, forcing many workers to stay on the job to try to recoup some of their savings losses. Some permanently left the stock market. Others were relying on the equity tied to their home values, which are still far below their peak. Again, we turn to Dante Chinni for insight about what&rsquo;s going on.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The Great Recession took a toll on the country as a whole, but it had special implications for older workers, pushing them back into the workplace. While the number of Americans in the workforce as a whole declined between 2008 and 2012&mdash;from 64% to 60%&mdash;the percentage of older Americans in the workforce actually grew, if only slightly. Between 2008 and 2012, the percentage of 60-plus aged Americans working full- or part-time inched up from 26% to 27%. Among those 65 or older, the percentage in the workforce grew slightly more, from 16% to 18%. One reason: the collapse of the stock market dealt a major blow to older Americans living off of retirement accounts with investments tied to the markets.
